In this section, I will try to establish functions about image processing executed with CPU and GPU and compare their performance. 

I should indicate that my platform is NVIDIA GTX1060, so I think it's not so fast as other platforms with better performance such as Titan.

so these results are restricted in some sense, but I will give some advice according to them.

I am new to cuda, so if there is some errors, please help me to deal with that, thank you.

uchar2Float: transform uchar-type images to float with cuda.
